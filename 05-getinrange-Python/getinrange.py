# Write the function getInRange(x, bound1, bound2) which takes 3 int values
# x, bound1, and bound2, where bound1 is not necessarily less than bound2. 
# If x is between the two bounds, just return it unmodified. Otherwise, 
# if x is less than the lower bound, return the lower bound, 
# or if x is greater than the upper bound, return the upper bound.

	# your code goes here
	if(bound2<x<bound1) or (bound1<x<bound2):
		return x

	elif(x<bound2):
